 	When was the last time you ordered Chinese take-out? Or visited your favorite boba shop? These businesses and aspects of Chinese culture are often the center of attention in pop culture for its oriental aesthetic appeal. But what people fail to realize is that these establishments they frequently visit are built upon the backs of Chinese immigrants, some of whom live in conditions depicted in the photo essay “81 Bowery,” photographed by Annie Ling.

 	Taipei born photographer Annie Ling documents the lives of those living in “81 Bowery,” one of the last surviving lodgings which houses immigrant Chinese laborers who work in New York City’s Chinatown’s construction sites and kitchens. 

 	This photo essay is a collection of 28 photos, one of which includes a text explaining her work, where Ling reveals the hardships and resilience of these residents who live in 64 square foot cubicles. There is a clear lack of representation on the housing crisis in mainstream media. But this is an enduring issue, as Ling depicts through her work.
