  	Annie Ling was raised by multiple families and frequently moved during her youth. This can be seen in her work in which she often grapples with displacement, shifting environments, and Asian culture. According to an interview with <i>The Margins</i>, Ling moved to New York City to pursue photography, where she experienced many hardships including a fire which burned down her apartment (Kondabolu). This may suggest why she was drawn to tell the story of “81 Bowery.”

  <p>This photo essay is a collection of 28 photos, one of which includes a text explaining her work, where Ling reveals the hardships and resilience of these residents who live in 64 square foot cubicles. There is a clear lack of representation on the housing crisis in mainstream media. But this is an enduring issue, as Ling depicts through her work. According to a demographic snapshot of the years 2015-2019 by the New York City's government, one in four Chinese immigrants live in poverty (NYC Opportunity). The lack of affordable housing options pushes many immigrants to live in overcrowded and poor maintenance accommodations, as depicted in “81 Bowery,” which results in generational poverty.</p>

  <p>
  Since 2011, when these photographs were taken, the residents of 81 Bowery were in danger of being evicted after concerned phone calls were made to the FDNY (Kondabolu). This would have left many residents homeless, and taken away the closest thing they had to a home. The article “Annie Ling Another Chinatown,’”published by TUNICA Studio, offers a new way to look at not only Ling’s work, but photography as a whole as not a call to action. Instead of being compelled to moralize what we see, perhaps we should become comfortable with feeling uncomfortable. 
</p>

<p>
With that being said, Ling shows us the two sided story of the American dream through the eyes of Chinese immigrant laborers, and their complex relationship with 81 Bowery. On one hand, it offers the immigrants a home away from home, and a community in which they can find solace within. But, the cramped and overcrowded living conditions make it clear that moving away from their friends, family, and culture is no easy path to take. In doing so, this pushes us to view the labor that immigrants provide in a different light. The small businesses and restaurants we often pass are no longer just an aesthetic fetishsized by pop culture, but a story of the resilience of these hardworking individuals.
